(b) any other contractors employed by the Employer, and
(c) the personnel of any legally constituted public authorities,
who may be employed in the execution on or near the Site of any work not included in the Contract.

Services for these personnel and other contractors may include the use of Contractor's Equipment, Temporary Works or access arrangements which are the responsibility of the Contractor.
The Contractor shall be responsible for his construction activities on the Site, and shall co-ordinate his own activities with those of other contractors to the extent (if any) specified in the Employer's Requirements.

The Employer shall be responsible for any errors in these specified or notified items of reference, but the Contractor shall use reasonable efforts to verify their accuracy before they are used.
If the Contractor suffers delay and/or incurs Cost from executing work which was necessitated by an error in these items of reference, and an experienced contractor could not reasonably have discovered such error and avoided this delay and/or Cost, the Contractor shall give notice to the Engineer and shall be entitled subject to Sub-Clause 20.1 [Contractor's Claims] to:
(a) an extension of time for any such delay, if completion is or will be delayed, under Sub-Clause 8.4 [Extension of Time for Completion], and

The Contractor shall be responsible for interpreting all such data.
To the extent which was practicable (taking account of cost and time), the Contractor shall be deemed to have obtained all necessary information as to risks, contingencies and other circumstances which may influence or affect the Tender or Works. To the same extent, the Contractor shall be deemed to have inspected and examined the Site, its surroundings, the above data and other available information, and to have been satisfied before submitting the Tender as to all relevant matters, including (without limitation):

This notice shall describe the physical conditions, so that they can be inspected by the Engineer, and shall set out the reasons why the Contractor considers them to be Unforeseeable. The Contractor shall continue executing the Works, using such proper and reasonable measures as are appropriate for the physical conditions, and shall comply with any instructions which the Engineer may give. If an instruction constitutes a Variation, Clause 13 [Variations and Adjustments] shall apply.
If and to the extent that the Contractor encounters physical conditions which are Unforeseeable, gives such a notice, and suffers delay and/or incurs Cost due to these conditions, the Contractor shall be entitled subject to Sub-Clause 20.1 [Contractor's Claims] to:
(a) an extension of time for any such delay, if completion is or will be delayed, under Sub-Clause 8.4 [Extension of Time for Completion], and

If and to the extent that these more favourable conditions were encountered, the Engineer may proceed in accordance with Sub- Clause 3.5 [Determinations] to agree or determine the reductions in Cost which were due to these conditions, which may be included (as deductions) in the Contract Price and Payment Certificates. However, the net effect of all adjustments under subparagraph (b) and all these reductions, for all the physical conditions encountered in similar parts of the Works, shall not result in a net reduction in the Contract Price.

Each sample shall be labelled as to origin and intended use in the Works."
7.3,Inspection,"The Employer's Personnel shall at all reasonable times:
(a) have full access to all parts of the Site and to all places from which natural Materials are being obtained, and
(b) during production, manufacture and construction (at the Site and elsewhere), be entitled to examine, inspect, measure and test the materials and workmanship, and to check the progress of manufacture of Plant and production and manufacture of Materials.
The Contractor shall give the Employer's Personnel full opportunity to carry out these activities, including providing access, facilities, permissions and safety equipment. No such activity shall relieve the Contractor from any obligation or responsibility.
The Contractor shall give notice to the Engineer whenever any work is ready and before it is covered up, put out of sight, or packaged for storage or transport. The Engineer shall then either carry out the examination, inspection, measurement or testing without unreasonable delay, or promptly give notice to the Contractor that the Engineer does not require to do so. If the Contractor fails to give the notice, he shall, if and when required by the Engineer, uncover the work and thereafter reinstate and make good, all at the Contractor's cost."
7.4,Testing,"This Sub-Clause shall apply to all tests specified in the Contract, other than the Tests after Completion (if any).
The Contractor shall provide all apparatus, assistance, documents and other information, electricity, equipment, fuel, consumables, instruments, labour, materials, and suitably qualified and experienced staff, as are necessary to carry out the specified tests efficiently. The Contractor shall agree, with the Engineer, the time and place for the specified testing of any Plant, Materials and other parts of the Works.
The Engineer may, under Clause 13 [Variations and Adjustments], vary the location or details of specified tests, or instruct the Contractor to carry out additional tests. If these varied or additional tests show that the tested Plant, Materials or workmanship is not in accordance with the Contract, the cost of carrying out this Variation shall be borne by the Contractor, notwithstanding other provisions of the Contract.
The Engineer shall give the Contractor not less than 24 hours' notice of the Engineer's intention to attend the tests. If the Engineer does not attend at the time and place agreed, the Contractor may proceed with the tests, unless otherwise instructed by the Engineer, and the tests shall then be deemed to have been made in the Engineer's presence.
If the Contractor suffers delay and/or incurs Cost from complying with these instructions or as a result of a delay for which the Employer is responsible, the Contractor shall give notice to the Engineer and shall be entitled subject to Sub- Clause 20.1 [Contractor's Claims] to:
a) an extension of time for any such delay, if completion is or will be delayed, under Sub-Clause 8.4 [Extension of Time for Completion], and
(b) payment of any such Cost plus reasonable profit, which shall be included in the Contract Price.
After receiving this notice, the Engineer shall proceed in accordance with Sub-Clause 3.5 [Determinations] to agree or determine these matters.
The Contractor shall promptly forward to the Engineer duly certified reports of the tests. When the specified tests have been passed, the Engineer shall endorse the Contractor's test certificate, or issue a certificate to him, to that effect. If the Engineer has not attended the tests, he shall be deemed to have accepted the readings as accurate."
7.5,Rejection,"If, as a result of an examination, inspection, measurement or testing, any Plant,
Materials, design or workmanship is found to be defective or otherwise not in accordance with the Contract, the Engineer may reject the Plant, Materials, design or workmanship by giving notice to the Contractor, with reasons. The Contractor shall then promptly make good the defect and ensure that the rejected item complies with the Contract.
If the Engineer requires this Plant, Materials, design or workmanship to be retested, the tests shall be repeated under the same terms and conditions. If the rejection and retesting cause the Employer to incur additional costs, the Contractor shall subject to Sub-Clause 2.5 [Employer's Claims] pay these costs to the Employer."
7.6,Remedial Work,"Notwithstanding any previous test or certification, the Engineer may instruct the Contractor to:
(a) remove from the Site and replace any Plant or Materials which is not in accordance with the Contract,
(b) remove and re-execute any other work which is not in accordance with the Contract, and
(c) execute any work which is urgently required for the safety of the Works, whether because of an accident, unforeseeable event or otherwise.
The Contractor shall comply with the instruction within a reasonable time, which shall be the time (if any) specified in the instruction, or immediately if urgency is specified under sub-paragraph (c).
If the Contractor fails to comply with the instruction, the Employer shall be entitled to employ and pay other persons to carry out the work. Except to the extent that the Contractor would have been entitled to payment for the work, the Contractor shall subject to Sub-Clause 2.5 [Employer's Claims] pay to the Employer all costs arising from this failure."
7.7,Ownership of Plant and Materials,"Each item of Plant and Materials shall, to the extent consistent with the Laws of the Country, become the property of the Employer at whichever is the earlier of the following times, free from liens and other encumbrances:

The Contractor shall commence the design and execution of the Works as soon as is reasonably practicable after the Commencement Date, and shall then proceed with the Works with due expedition and without delay."
8.2,Time for Completion,"The Contractor shall complete the whole of the Works, and each Section (if any), within the Time for Completion for the Works or Section (as the case may be), including:
(a) achieving the passing of the Tests on Completion, and

8.3,Programme,"The Contractor shall submit a detailed time programme to the Engineer within 28 days after receiving the notice under Sub-Clause 8.1 [Commencement of Works]. The Contractor shall also submit a revised programme whenever the previous programme is inconsistent with actual progress or with the Contractor's obligations. Each programme shall include:
(a) the order in which the Contractor intends to carry out the Works, including the anticipated timing of each stage of design, Contractor's Documents, procurement, manufacture, inspection, delivery to Site, construction, erection, testing, commissioning and trial operation,
(b) the periods for reviews under Sub-Clause 5.2 [Contractor's Documents] and for any other submissions, approvals and consents specified in the Employer's Requirements,
(c) the sequence and timing of inspections and tests specified in the Contract, and
(d) a supporting report which includes:

Unless the Engineer, within 21 days after receiving a programme, gives notice to the Contractor stating the extent to which it does not comply with the Contract, the Contractor shall proceed in accordance with the programme, subject to his other obligations under the Contract. The Employer's Personnel shall be entitled to rely upon the programme when planning their activities.
The Contractor shall promptly give notice to the Engineer of specific probable future events or circumstances which may adversely affect the work, increase the Contract Price or delay the execution of the Works. The Engineer may require the Contractor to submit an estimate of the anticipated effect of the future event or circumstances, and/or a proposal under Sub-Clause 13.3 [Variation Procedure].
If, at any time, the Engineer gives notice to the Contractor that a programme fails (to the extent stated) to comply with the Contract or to be consistent with actual progress and the Contractor's stated intentions, the Contractor shall submit a revised programme to the Engineer in accordance with this Sub-Clause"
8.4,Extension of Time for Completion,"The Contractor shall be entitled subject to Sub-Clause 20.1 [Contractor's Claims] to an extension of the Time for Completion if and to the extent that completion for the purposes of Sub-Clause 10.1 [Taking Over of the Works and Sections] is or will be delayed by any of the following causes:
(a) a Variation (unless an adjustment to the Time for Completion has been agreed under Sub-Clause 13.3 [Variation Procedure]),
(b) a cause of delay giving an entitlement to extension of time under a Sub-Clause of these Conditions,
(c) exceptionally adverse climatic conditions,
(d) Unforeseeable shortages in the availability of personnel or Goods caused by epidemic or governmental actions, or
(e) any delay, impediment or prevention caused by or attributable to the Employer, the Employer's Personnel, or the Employer's other contractors on the Site.
If the Contractor considers himself to be entitled to an extension of the Time for Completion, the Contractor shall give notice to the Engineer in accordance with Sub-Clause 20.1 [Contractor's Claims]. When determining each extension of time under Sub-Clause 20.1, the Engineer shall review previous determinations and may increase, but shall not decrease, the total extension of time."
8.5,Delays Caused by Authorities,"If the following conditions apply, namely:
(a) the Contractor has diligently followed the procedures laid down by the relevant legally constituted public authorities in the Country,
(b) these authorities delay or disrupt the Contractor's work, and
(c) the delay or disruption was Unforeseeable,
then this delay or disruption will be considered as a cause of delay under subparagraph (b) of Sub-Clause 8.4 [Extension of Time for Completion]."
8.6,Rate of Progress,"If, at any time:
(a) actual progress is too slow to complete within the Time for Completion, and/or
(b) progress has fallen (or will fall) behind the current programme under Sub-Clause 8.3 [Programme],
other than as a result of a cause listed in Sub-Clause 8.4 [Extension of Time for Completion], then the Engineer may instruct the Contractor to submit, under Sub-Clause 8.3 [Programme], a revised programme and supporting report describing the revised methods which the Contractor proposes to adopt in order to expedite progress and complete within the Time for Completion.
Unless the Engineer notifies otherwise, the Contractor shall adopt these revised methods, which may require increases in the working hours and/or in the numbers of Contractor's Personnel and/or Goods, at the risk and cost of the Contractor. If these revised methods cause the Employer to incur additional costs, the Contractor shall subject to Sub-Clause 2.5 [Employer's Claims] pay these costs to the Employer, in addition to delay damages (if any) under Sub-Clause 8.7 below."
8.7,Delay Damages,"If the Contractor fails to comply with Sub-Clause 8.2 [Time for Completion], the Contractor shall subject to Sub-Clause 2.5 [Employer's Claims] pay delay damages to the Employer for this default. These delay damages shall be the sum stated in the Appendix to Tender, which shall be paid for every day which shall elapse between the relevant Time for Completion and the date stated in the Taking-Over Certificate. However, the total amount due under this Sub-Clause shall not exceed the maximum amount of delay damages (if any) stated in the Appendix to Tender.
These delay damages shall be the only damages due from the Contractor for such default, other than in the event of termination under Sub-Clause 15.2 [Termination by Employer] prior to completion of the Works. These damages shall not relieve the Contractor from his obligation to complete the Works, or from any other duties, obligations or responsibilities which he may have under the Contract."
8.8,Suspension of Work,"The Engineer may at any time instruct the Contractor to suspend progress of part or all of the Works. During such suspension, the Contractor shall protect, store and secure such part or the Works against any deterioration, loss or damage.
The Engineer may also notify the cause for the suspension. If and to the extent that the cause is notified and is the responsibility of the Contractor, the following Sub-Clauses 8.9, 8.10 and 8.11 shall not apply."
8.9,Consequences of Suspension,"If the Contractor suffers delay and/or incurs Cost from complying with the Engineer's instructions under Sub-Clause 8.8 [Suspension of Work] and/or from resuming the work, the Contractor shall give notice to the Engineer and shall be entitled subject to Sub-Clause 20.1 [Contractor's Claims] to:
(a) an extension of time for any such delay, if completion is or will be delayed, under Sub-Clause 8.4 [Extension of Time for Completion], and
(b) payment of any such Cost, which shall be included in the Contract Price. 
After receiving this notice, the Engineer shall proceed in accordance with Sub-Clause 3.5 [Determinations] to agree or determine these matters.
The Contractor shall not be entitled to an extension of time for, or to payment of the Cost incurred in, making good the consequences of the Contractor's faulty design, workmanship or materials, or of the Contractor's failure to protect, store or secure in accordance with Sub-Clause 8.8 [Suspension of Work]."
8.10,Payment for Plant and Materials in Event of Suspension,"The Contractor shall be entitled to payment of the value (as at the date of suspension) of Plant and/or Materials which have not been delivered to Site, if:
(a) the work on Plant or delivery of Plant and/or Materials has been suspended for more than 28 days, and
(b) the Contractor has marked the Plant and/or Materials as the Employer's property in accordance with the Engineer's instructions."
8.11,Prolonged Suspension,"If the suspension under Sub-Clause 8.8 [Suspension of Work] has continued for more than 84 days, the Contractor may request the Engineer's permission to proceed. If the Engineer does not give permission within 28 days after being requested to do so, the Contractor may, by giving notice to the Engineer, treat the suspension as an omission under Clause 13 [Variations and Adjustments] of the affected part of the Works. If the suspension affects the whole of the Works, the Contractor may give notice of termination under Sub-Clause 16.2 [Termination by Contractor]."
8.12,Resumption of Work,"After the permission or instruction to proceed is given, the Contractor and the Engineer shall jointly examine the Works and the Plant and Materials affected by the suspension. The Contractor shall make good any deterioration or defect in or loss of the Works or Plant or Materials, which has occurred during the suspension."
9.1,Contractor's Obligations,"The Contractor shall carry out the Tests on Completion in accordance with this Clause and Sub-Clause 7.4 [Testing], after providing the documents in accordance with Sub-Clause 5.6 [As-Built Documents] and Sub-Clause 5.7 [Operation and Maintenance Manuals].
The Contractor shall give to the Engineer not less than 21 days' notice of the date after which the Contractor will be ready to carry out each of the Tests on Completion.Unless otherwise agreed, Tests on Completion shall be carried out within 14 days after this date, on such day or days as the Engineer shall instruct.
Unless otherwise stated in the Particular Conditions, the Tests on Completion shall be carried out in the following sequence:
(a) pre-commissioning tests, which shall include the appropriate inspections and (""dry"" or ""cold"") functional tests to demonstrate that each item of Plant can safely undertake the next stage, (b);
(b) commissioning tests, which shall include the specified operational tests to demonstrate that the Works or Section can be operated safely and as specified, under all available operating conditions; and (c) trial operation, which shall demonstrate that the Works or Section perform reliably and in accordance with the Contract.
During trial operation, when the Works are operating under stable conditions, the Contractor shall give notice to the Engineer that the Works are ready for any other Tests on Completion, including performance tests to demonstrate whether the Works conform with criteria specified in the Employer's Requirements and with the Schedule of Guarantees.
Trial operation shall not constitute a taking-over under Clause 10 [Employer's Taking Over]. Unless otherwise stated in the Particular Conditions, any product produced by the Works during trial operation shall be the property of the Employer.
In considering the results of the Tests on Completion, the Engineer shall make allowances for the effect of any use of the Works by the Employer on the performance or other characteristics of the Works. As soon as the Works, or a Section, have passed each of the Tests on Completion described in sub-paragraph (a), (b) or (c), the Contractor shall submit a certified report of the results of these Tests to the Engineer."
9.2,Delayed Tests,"If the Tests on Completion are being unduly delayed by the Employer, Sub-Clause 7.4 [Testing] (fifth paragraph) and/or Sub-Clause 10.3 [Interference with Tests on Completion] shall be applicable.
If the Tests on Completion are being unduly delayed by the Contractor, the Engineer may by notice require the Contractor to carry out the Tests within 21 days after receiving the notice. The Contractor shall carry out the Tests on such day or days within that period as the Contractor may fix and of which he shall give notice to the Engineer.
If the Contractor fails to carry out the Tests on Completion within the period of 21 days, the Employer's Personnel may proceed with the Tests at the risk and cost of the Contractor. The Tests on Completion shall then be deemed to have been carried out in the presence of the Contractor and the results of the Tests shall be accepted as accurate."
9.3,Retesting,"If the Works, or a Section, fail to pass the Tests on Completion, Sub-Clause 7.5 [Rejection] shall apply, and the Engineer or the Contractor may require the failed Tests, and Tests on Completion on any related work, to be repeated under the same terms and conditions."
9.4,Failure to Pass Tests on Completion,"If the Works, or a Section, fail to pass the Tests on Completion repeated under Sub-Clause 9.3 [Retesting], the Engineer shall be entitled to:
(a) order further repetition of Tests on Completion under Sub-Clause 9.3;
(b) if the failure deprives the Employer of substantially the whole benefit of the Works or Section, reject the Works or Section (as the case may be), in which event the Employer shall have the same remedies as are provided in subparagraph (c) of Sub-Clause 11.4 [Failure to Remedy Defects]; or 
(c) issue a Taking-Over Certificate, if the Employer so requests.
In the event of sub-paragraph (c), the Contractor shall then proceed in accordance with all other obligations under the Contract, and the Contract Price shall be reduced by such amount as shall be appropriate to cover the reduced value to the Employer as a result of this failure. Unless the relevant reduction for this failure is stated (or its method of calculation is defined) in the Contract, the Employer may require the reduction to be (i) agreed by both Parties (in full satisfaction of this failure only) and paid before this Taking-Over Certificate is issued, or (ii) determined and paid under Sub-Clause 2.5 [Employer's Claims] and Sub-Clause 3.5 [Determinations]."
10.1,Taking Over of the Works and Sections,"Except as stated in Sub-Clause 9.4 [Failure to Pass Tests on Completion], the Works shall be taken over by the Employer when (i) the Works have been completed in accordance with the Contract, including the matters described in Sub-Clause 8.2 [Time for Completion] and except as allowed in sub-paragraph (a) below, and (ii) a Taking-Over Certificate for the Works has been issued, or is deemed to have been issued in accordance with this Sub-Clause.
The Contractor may apply by notice to the Engineer for a Taking-Over Certificate not earlier than 14 days before the Works will, in the Contractor's opinion, be complete and ready for taking over. If the Works are divided into Sections, the Contractor may similarly apply for a Taking-Over Certificate for each Section.
The Engineer shall, within 28 days after receiving the Contractor's application:
(a) issue the Taking-Over Certificate to the Contractor, stating the date on which the Works or Section were completed in accordance with the Contract, except for any minor outstanding work and defects which will not substantially affect
the use of the Works or Section for their intended purpose (either until or whilst this work is completed and these defects are remedied); or
(b) reject the application, giving reasons and specifying the work required to be done by the Contractor to enable the Taking-Over Certificate to be issued. The Contractor shall then complete this work before issuing a further notice under this Sub-Clause.
If the Engineer fails either to issue the Taking-Over Certificate or to reject the Contractor s application with the period of 28 days, and if the Works or Section (as the case may be) are substantially in accordance with the Contract, the Taking-Over Certificate shall be deemed to have been issued on the last day of that period."
10.2,Taking Over of Parts of the Works,"The Engineer may, at the sole discretion of the Employer, issue a Taking-Over Certificate for any part of the Permanent Works.
The Employer shall not use any part of the Works (other than as a temporary measure which is either specified in the Contract or agreed by both Parties) unless and until the Engineer has issued a Taking-Over Certificate for this part. However, if the Employer does use any part of the Works before the Taking-Over Certificate is issued:
(a) the part which is used shall be deemed to have been taken over as from the date on which it is used,
(b) the Contractor shall cease to be liable for the care of such part as from this date, when responsibility shall pass to the Employer, and
(c) if requested by the Contractor, the Engineer shall issue a Taking-Over Certificate for this part.
After the Engineer has issued a Taking-Over Certificate for a part of the Works, the Contractor shall be given the earliest opportunity to take such steps as may be necessary to carry out any outstanding Tests on Completion. The Contractor shall carry out these Tests on Completion as soon as practicable before the expiry date of the relevant Defects Notification Period.
If the Contractor incurs Cost as a result of the Employer taking over and/or using a part of the Works, other than such use as is specified in the Contract or agreed by the Contractor, the Contractor shall (i) give notice to the Engineer and (ii) be entitled subject to Sub-Clause 20.1 [Contractor's Claims] to payment of any such Cost plus reasonable profit, which shall be included in the Contract Price. After receiving this notice, the Engineer shall proceed in accordance with Sub-Clause 3.5 [Determinations] to agree or determine this Cost and profit.
If a Taking-Over Certificate has been issued for a part of the Works (other than a Section), the delay damages thereafter for completion of the remainder of the Works shall be reduced. Similarly, the delay damages for the remainder of the Section (if any) in which this part is included shall also be reduced. For any period of delay after the date stated in this Taking-Over Certificate, the proportional reduction in these delay damages shall be calculated as the proportion which the value of the part so certified bears to the value of the Works or Section (as the case may be) as a whole. The Engineer shall proceed in accordance with Sub-Clause 3.5 [Determinations] to agree or determine these proportions. The provisions of this paragraph shall only apply to the daily rate of delay damages under Sub-Clause 8.7 [Delay Damages], and shall not affect the maximum amount of these damages."
10.3,Interference with Tests on Completion,"If the Contractor is prevented, for more than 14 days, from carrying out the Tests on Completion by a cause for which the Employer is responsible, the Employer shall be deemed to have taken over the Works or Section (as the case may be) on the date when the Tests on Completion would otherwise have been completed.
The Engineer shall then issue a Taking-Over Certificate accordingly, and the Contractor shall carry out the Tests on Completion as soon as practicable, before the expiry date of the Defects Notification Period. The Engineer shall require the Tests on Completion to be carried out by giving 14 days' notice and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Contract.
If the Contractor suffers delay and/or incurs Cost as a result of this delay in carrying out the Tests on Completion, the Contractor shall give notice to the Engineer and shall be entitled subject to Sub-Clause 20.1 [Contractor's Claims] to:
(a) an extension of time for any such delay, if completion is or will be delayed, under Sub-Clause 8.4 [Extension of Time for Completion], and
(b) payment of any such Cost plus reasonable profit, which shall be included in the Contract Price.
After receiving this notice, the Engineer shall proceed in accordance with Sub-Clause 3.5 [Determinations] to agree or determine these matters."
10.4,Surfaces Requiring Reinstatement,"Except as otherwise stated in a Taking-Over Certificate, a certificate for a Section or part of the Works shall not be deemed to certify completion of any ground or other surfaces requiring reinstatement."
11.1,Completion of Outstanding Work and Remedying Defects,"In order that the Works and Contractor's Documents, and each Section, shall be in the condition required by the Contract (fair wear and tear excepted) by the expiry date of the relevant Defects Notification Period or as soon as practicable thereafter, the Contractor shall:
(a) complete any work which is outstanding on the date stated in a Taking-Over Certificate, within such reasonable time as is instructed by the Engineer, and
(b) execute all work required to remedy defects or damage, as may be notified by (or on behalf of) the Employer on or before the expiry date of the Defects Notification Period for the Works or Section (as the case may be).
If a defect appears or damage occurs, the Contractor shall be notified accordingly, by (or on behalf of) the Employer."
11.2,Cost of Remedying Defects,"All work referred to in sub-paragraph (b) of Sub-Clause 11.1 [Completion of Outstanding Work and Remedying Defects] shall be executed at the risk and cost of the Contractor, if and to the extent that the work is attributable to:
(a) the design of the Works, other than a part of the design for which the Employer is responsible (if any),
(b) Plant, Materials or workmanship not being in accordance with the Contract,(c) improper operation or maintenance which was attributable to matters for which the Contractor is responsible (under Sub-Clauses 5.5 to 5.7 or otherwise), or (d) failure by the Contractor to comply with any other obligation.
If and to the extent that such work is attributable to any other cause, the Contractor shall be notified promptly by (or on behalf of) the Employer, and Sub-Clause 13.3 [Variation Procedure] shall apply."
11.3,Extension of Defects Notification Period,"The Employer shall be entitled subject to Sub-Clause 2.5 [Employer's Claims] to an extension of the Defects Notification Period for the Works or a Section if and to the extent that the Works, Section or a major item of Plant (as the case may be, and after taking over) cannot be used for the purposes for which they are intended by reason of a defect or damage. However, a Defects Notification Period shall not be extended by more than two years.
If delivery and/or erection of Plant and/or Materials was suspended under Sub-Clause 8.8 [Suspension of Work] or Sub-Clause 16.1 [Contractor's Entitlement to Suspend Work], the Contractor's obligations under this Clause shall not apply to any defects or damage occurring more than two years after the Defects Notification Period for the Plant and/or Materials would otherwise have expired."
11.4,Failure to Remedy Defects,"If the Contractor fails to remedy any defect or damage within a reasonable time, a date may be fixed by (or on behalf of) the Employer, on or by which the defect or damage is to be remedied. The Contractor shall be given reasonable notice of this date. If the Contractor fails to remedy the defect or damage by this notified date and this remedial work was to be executed at the cost of the Contractor under Sub-Clause 11.2 [Cost of Remedying Defects], the Employer may (at his option):
(a) carry out the work himself or by others, in a reasonable manner and at the Contractor's cost, but the Contractor shall have no responsibility for this work; and the Contractor shall subject to Sub-Clause 2.5 [Employer's Claims] pay to the Employer the costs reasonably incurred by the Employer in remedying the defect or damage;
(b) require the Engineer to agree or determine a reasonable reduction in the Contract Price in accordance with Sub-Clause 3.5 [Determinations]; or
(c) if the defect or damage deprives the Employer of substantially the whole benefit of the Works or any major part of the Works, terminate the Contract as a whole, or in respect of such major part which cannot be put to the intended use.
Without prejudice to any other rights, under the Contract or otherwise, the Employer shall then be entitled to recover all sums paid for the Works or for such part (as the case may be), plus financing costs and the cost of dismantling the same, clearing the Site and returning Plant and Materials to the Contractor."
11.5,Removal of Defective Work,"If the defect or damage cannot be remedied expeditiously on the Site and the Employer gives consent, the Contractor may remove from the Site for the purposes of repair such items of Plant as are defective or damaged. This consent may require the Contractor to increase the amount of the Performance Security by the full replacement cost of these items, or to provide other appropriate security."
11.6,Further Tests,"If the work of remedying of any defect or damage may affect the performance of the Works, the Engineer may require the repetition of any of the tests described in the Contract, including Tests on Completion and/or Tests after Completion. The requirement shall be made by notice within 28 days after the defect or damage is remedied.
These tests shall be carried out in accordance with the terms applicable to the previous tests, except that they shall be carried out at the risk and cost of the Party liable, under Sub-Clause 11.2 [Cost of Remedying Defects], for the cost of the remedial work."
11.7,Right of Access,"Until the Performance Certificate has been issued, the Contractor shall have the right of access to all parts of the Works and to records of the operation and performance of the Works, except as may be inconsistent with the Employer's reasonable security restrictions."
11.8,Contractor to Search,"The Contractor shall, if required by the Engineer, search for the cause of any defect, under the direction of the Engineer. Unless the defect is to be remedied at the cost of the Contractor under Sub-Clause 11.2 [Cost of Remedying Defects], the Cost of the search plus reasonable profit shall be agreed or determined by the Engineer in accordance with Sub-Clause 3.5 [Determinations] and shall be included in the Contract Price."
11.9,Performance Certificate,"Performance of the Contractor's obligations shall not be considered to have been completed until the Engineer has issued the Performance Certificate to the Contractor, stating the date on which the Contractor completed his obligations under the Contract.
The Engineer shall issue the Performance Certificate within 28 days after the latest of the expiry dates of the Defects Notification Periods, or as soon thereafter as the Contractor has supplied all the Contractor's Documents and completed and tested all the Works, including remedying any defects. A copy of the Performance Certificate shall be issued to the Employer.
Only the Performance Certificate shall be deemed to constitute acceptance of the Works."
11.10,Unfulfilled Obligations,"After the Performance Certificate has been issued, each Party shall remain liable for the fulfilment of any obligation which remains unperformed at that time. For the purposes of determining the nature and extent of unperformed obligations, the Contract shall be deemed to remain in force."
11.11,Clearance of Site,"Upon receiving the Performance Certificate, the Contractor shall remove any remaining Contractor's Equipment, surplus material, wreckage, rubbish and Temporary Works from the Site.
If all these items have not been removed within 28 days after the Employer receives a copy of the Performance Certificate, the Employer may sell or otherwise dispose of any remaining items. The Employer shall be entitled to be paid the costs incurred in connection with, or attributable to, such sale or disposal and restoring the Site.
Any balance of the moneys from the sale shall be paid to the Contractor. If these moneys are less than the Employer's costs, the Contractor shall pay the outstanding balance to the Employer."
12.1,Procedure for Tests after Completion,"If Tests after Completion are specified in the Contract, this Clause shall apply. Unless otherwise stated in the Particular Conditions, the Employer shall: 
(a) provide all electricity, equipment, fuel, instruments, labour, materials, and suitably qualified and experienced staff, as are necessary to carry out the Tests after Completion efficiently, and
(b) carry out the Tests after Completion in accordance with the manuals supplied by the Contractor under Sub-Clause 5.7 [Operation and Maintenance Manuals] and such guidance as the Contractor may be required to give during the course of these Tests; and in the presence of such Contractor's Personnel as either Party may reasonably request.
The Tests after Completion shall be carried out as soon as is reasonably practicable after the Works or Section have been taken over by the Employer. The Employer shall give to the Contractor 21 days' notice of the date after which the Tests after Completion will be carried out. Unless otherwise agreed, these Tests shall be carried out within 14 days after this date, on the day or days determined by the Employer.
If the Contractor does not attend at the time and place agreed, the Employer may proceed with the Tests after Completion, which shall be deemed to have been made in the Contractor's presence, and the Contractor shall accept the readings as accurate.
The results of the Tests after Completion shall be compiled and evaluated by both Parties. Appropriate account shall be taken of the effect of the Employer's prior use of the Works."
12.2,Delayed Tests,"If the Contractor incurs Cost as a result of any unreasonable delay by the Employer to the Tests after Completion, the Contractor shall (i) give notice to the Engineer and (ii) be entitled subject to Sub-Clause 20.1 [Contractor's Claims] to payment of any such Cost plus reasonable profit, which shall be included in the Contract Price. 
After receiving this notice, the Engineer shall proceed in accordance with Sub-Clause 3.5 [Determinations] to agree or determine this Cost and profit.
If, for reasons not attributable to the Contractor, a Test after Completion on the Works or any Section cannot be completed during the Defects Notification Period (or any other period agreed upon by both Parties), then the Works or Section shall be deemed to have passed this Test after Completion."
12.3,Retesting,"If the Works, or a Section, fail to pass the Tests after Completion:
(a) sub-paragraph (b) of Sub-Clause 11.1 [Completion of Outstanding Work and Remedying Defects] shall apply, and
(b) either Party may then require the failed Tests, and the Tests after Completion on any related work, to be repeated under the same terms and conditions.
If and to the extent that this failure and retesting are attributable to any of the matters listed in sub-paragraphs (a) to (d) of Sub-Clause 11.2 [Cost of Remedying Defects] and cause the Employer to incur additional costs, the Contractor shall subject to Sub- Clause 2.5 [Employer's Claims] pay these costs to the Employer."
12.4,Failure to Pass Tests after Completion,"If the following conditions apply, namely:
(a) the Works, or a Section, fail to pass any or all of the Tests after Completion,
(b) the relevant sum payable as non-performance damages for this failure is stated (or its method of calculation is defined) in the Contract, and
(c) the Contractor pays this relevant sum to the Employer during the Defects Notification Period,
then the Works or Section shall be deemed to have passed these Tests after Completion.
If the Works, or a Section, fail to pass a Test after Completion and the Contractor proposes to make adjustments or modifications to the Works or such Section, the Contractor may be instructed by (or on behalf of) the Employer that right of access to the Works or Section cannot be given until a time that is convenient to the Employer. The Contractor shall then remain liable to carry out the adjustments or modifications and to satisfy this Test, within a reasonable period of receiving notice by (or on behalf of) the Employer of the time that is convenient to the Employer. However, if the Contractor does not receive this notice during the relevant Defects Notification Period, the Contractor shall be relieved of this obligation and the Works or Section (as the case may be) shall be deemed to have passed this Test after Completion.
If the Contractor incurs additional Cost as a result of any unreasonable delay by the Employer in permitting access to the Works or Plant by the Contractor, either to investigate the causes of a failure to pass a Test after Completion or to carry out any adjustments or modifications, the Contractor shall (i) give notice to the Engineer and (ii) be entitled subject to Sub-Clause 20.1 [Contractor's Claims] to payment of any such Cost plus reasonable profit, which shall be included in the Contract Price.
After receiving this notice, the Engineer shall proceed in accordance with Sub-Clause 3.5 [Determinations] to agree or determine this Cost and profit."
13.1,Right to Vary,"Variations may be initiated by the Engineer at any time prior to issuing the Taking-Over Certificate for the Works, either by an instruction or by a request for the Contractor to submit a proposal. A Variation shall not comprise the omission of any work which is to be carried out by others.
The Contractor shall execute and be bound by each Variation, unless the Contractor promptly gives notice to the Engineer stating (with supporting particulars) that (i) the Contractor cannot readily obtain the Goods required for the Variation, (ii) it will reduce the safety or suitability of the Works, or (iii) it will have an adverse impact on the achievement of the Schedule of Guarantees. Upon receiving this notice, the Engineer shall cancel, confirm or vary the instruction."
13.2,Value Engineering,"The Contractor may, at any time, submit to the Engineer a written proposal which (in the Contractor's opinion) will, if adopted, (i) accelerate completion, (ii) reduce the cost to the Employer of executing, maintaining or operating the Works, (iii) improve the efficiency or value to the Employer of the completed Works, or (iv) otherwise be of benefit to the Employer.
The proposal shall be prepared at the cost of the Contractor and shall include the items listed in Sub-Clause 13.3 [Variation Procedure]."
13.3,Variation Procedure,"If the Engineer requests a proposal, prior to instructing a Variation, the Contractor shall respond in writing as soon as practicable, either by giving reasons why he cannot comply (if this is the case) or by submitting:
(a) a description of the proposed design and/or work to be performed and a programme for its execution,
(b) the Contractor's proposal for any necessary modifications to the programme according to Sub-Clause 8.3 [Programme] and to the Time for Completion, and (c) the Contractor's proposal for adjustment to the Contract Price.
The Engineer shall, as soon as practicable after receiving such proposal (under Sub-Clause 13.2 [Value Engineering] or otherwise), respond with approval, disapproval or comments. The Contractor shall not delay any work whilst awaiting a response. 
Each instruction to execute a Variation, with any requirements for the recording of Costs, shall be issued by the Engineer to the Contractor, who shall acknowledge receipt.
Upon instructing or approving a Variation, the Engineer shall proceed in accordance with Sub-Clause 3.5 [Determinations] to agree or determine adjustments to the Contract Price and the Schedule of Payments. These adjustments shall include reasonable profit, and shall take account of the Contractor's submissions under Sub-Clause 13.2 [Value Engineering] if applicable."
13.4,Payment in Applicable Currencies,"If the Contract provides for payment of the Contract Price in more than one currency, then whenever an adjustment is agreed, approved or determined as stated above, the amount payable in each of the applicable currencies shall be specified. For this purpose, reference shall be made to the actual or expected currency proportions of the Cost of the varied work, and to the proportions of various currencies specified for payment of the Contract Price."
13.5,Provisional Sums,"Each Provisional Sum shall only be used, in whole or in part, in accordance with the Engineer's instructions, and the Contract Price shall be adjusted accordingly. The total sum paid to the Contractor shall include only such amounts, for the work, supplies or services to which the Provisional Sum relates, as the Engineer shall have instructed. For each Provisional Sum, the Engineer may instruct:
(a) work to be executed (including Plant, Materials or services to be supplied) by the Contractor and valued under Sub-Clause 13.3 [Variation Procedure]; and/or
(b) Plant, Materials or services to be purchased by the Contractor, for which there shall be included in the Contract Price:
(i) the actual amounts paid (or due to be paid) by the Contractor, and
(ii) a sum for overhead charges and profit, calculated as a percentage of these actual amounts by applying the relevant percentage rate (if any) stated in the appropriate Schedule. If there is no such rate, the percentage rate stated in the Appendix to Tender shall be applied.
The Contractor shall, when required by the Engineer, produce quotations, invoices, vouchers and accounts or receipts in substantiation."
13.6,Daywork,"For work of a minor or incidental nature, the Engineer may instruct that a Variation shall be executed on a daywork basis. The work shall then be valued in accordance with the daywork schedule included in the Contract, and the following procedure shall apply. If a daywork schedule is not included in the Contract, this Sub-Clause shall not apply.
Before ordering Goods for the work, the Contractor shall submit quotations to the Engineer. When applying for payment, the Contractor shall submit invoices, vouchers and accounts or receipts for any Goods.
Except for any items for which the daywork schedule specifies that payment is not due, the Contractor shall deliver each day to the Engineer accurate statements in duplicate which shall include the following details of the resources used in executing the previous day's work:
(a) the names, occupations and time of Contractor's Personnel,
(b) the identification, type and time of Contractor's Equipment and Temporary Works, and
(c) the quantities and types of Plant and Materials used. One copy of each statement will, if correct, or when agreed, be signed by the Engineer and returned to the Contractor. The Contractor shall then submit priced statements of these resources to the Engineer, prior to their inclusion in the next Statement under Sub-Clause 14.3 [Application for Interim Payment Certificates]."
13.7,Adjustments for Changes in Legislation,"The Contract Price shall be adjusted to take account of any increase or decrease in Cost resulting from a change in the Laws of the Country (including the introduction of new Laws and the repeal or modification of existing Laws) or in the judicial or official governmental interpretation of such Laws, made after the Base Date, which affect the Contractor in the performance of obligations under the Contract.
If the Contractor suffers (or will suffer) delay and/or incurs (or will incur) additional Cost as a result of these changes in the Laws or in such interpretations, made after the Base Date, the Contractor shall give notice to the Engineer and shall be entitled subject to Sub-Clause 20.1 [Contractor's Claims] to:
(a) an extension of time for any such delay, if completion is or will be delayed, under Sub-Clause 8.4 [Extension of Time for Completion], and
(b) payment of any such Cost, which shall be included in the Contract Price.
After receiving this notice, the Engineer shall proceed in accordance with Sub-Clause 3.5 [Determinations] to agree or determine these matters."
13.8,Adjustments for Changes in Cost,"In this Sub-Clause, ""table of adjustment data"" means the completed table of adjustment data included in the Appendix to Tender. If there is no such table of adjustment data, this Sub-Clause shall not apply.
If this Sub-Clause applies, the amounts payable to the Contractor shall be adjusted for rises or falls in the cost of labour, Goods and other inputs to the Works, by the addition or deduction of the amounts determined by the formulae prescribed in this Sub-Clause. To the extent that full compensation for any rise or fall in Costs is not covered by the provisions of this or other Clauses, the Accepted Contract Amount shall be deemed to have included amounts to cover the contingency of other rises and falls in costs.
The adjustment to be applied to the amount otherwise payable to the Contractor, as valued in accordance with the appropriate Schedule and certified in Payment Certificates, shall be determined from formulae for each of the currencies in which the Contract Price is payable. No adjustment is to be applied to work valued on the basis of Cost or current prices. The formulae shall be of the following general type:
Pn = a + b(Ln/Lo) + c(En/Eo) + d(Mn/Mo) + ......
where:
""Pn"" is the adjustment multiplier to be applied to the estimated contract value in the relevant currency of the work carried out in period ""n"", this period being a month unless otherwise stated in the Appendix to Tender;
""a"" is a fixed coefficient, stated in the relevant table of adjustment data, representing the non-adjustable portion in contractual payments;
""b"", ""c"", ""d"",   are coefficients representing the estimated proportion of each cost element related to the execution of the Works, as stated in the relevant table of adjustment data; such tabulated cost elements may be indicative of resources such as labour, equipment and materials;
""Ln"", ""En"", ""Mn"",   are the current cost indices or reference prices for period ""n"", expressed in the relevant currency of payment, each of which is applicable to the relevant tabulated cost element on the date 49 days prior to the last day of the period (to which the particular Payment Certificate relates); and
""Lo"", ""Eo"", ""Mo"",   are the base cost indices or reference prices, expressed in the relevant currency of payment, each of which is applicable to the relevant tabulated cost element on the Base Date.
The cost indices or reference prices stated in the table of adjustment data shall be used. If their source is in doubt, it shall be determined by the Engineer. For this purpose, reference shall be made to the values of the indices at stated dates (quoted in the fourth and fifth columns respectively of the table) for the purposes of clarification of the source; although these dates (and thus these values) may not correspond to the base cost indices.
In cases where the ""currency of index"" (stated in the table) is not the relevant currency of payment, each index shall be converted into the relevant currency of payment at the selling rate, established by the central bank of the Country, of this relevant currency on the above date for which the index is required to be applicable.
Until such time as each current cost index is available, the Engineer shall determine a provisional index for the issue of Interim Payment Certificates. When a current cost index is available, the adjustment shall be recalculated accordingly.
If the Contractor fails to complete the Works within the Time for Completion, adjustment of prices thereafter shall be made using either (i) each index or price applicable on the date 49 days prior to the expiry of the Time for Completion of the Works, or (ii) the current index or price: whichever is more favourable to the Employer.
The weightings (coefficients) for each of the factors of cost stated in the table(s) of adjustment data shall only be adjusted if they have been rendered unreasonable, unbalanced or inapplicable, as a result of Variations."
14.1,The Contract Price,"Unless otherwise stated in the Particular Conditions:
(a) the Contract Price shall be the lump sum Accepted Contract Amount and be subject to adjustments in accordance with the Contract;
(b) the Contractor shall pay all taxes, duties and fees required to be paid by him under the Contract, and the Contract Price shall not be adjusted for any of these costs, except as stated in Sub-Clause 13.7 [Adjustments for Changes in Legislation];
(c) any quantities which may be set out in a Schedule are estimated quantities and are not to be taken as the actual and correct quantities of the Works which the Contractor is required to execute; and
(d) any quantities or price data which may be set out in a Schedule shall be used for the purposes stated in the Schedule and may be inapplicable for other purposes.
However, if any part of the Works is to be paid according to quantity supplied or work done, the provisions for measurement and evaluation shall be as stated in the Particular Conditions. The Contract Price shall be determined accordingly, subject to adjustments in accordance with the Contract."
14.2,Advance Payment,"The Employer shall make an advance payment, as an interest-free loan for mobilisation and design, when the Contractor submits a guarantee in accordance with this Sub-Clause. The total advance payment, the number and timing of instalments (if more than one), and the applicable currencies and proportions, shall be as stated in the Appendix to Tender.
Unless and until the Employer receives this guarantee, or if the total advance payment is not stated in the Appendix to Tender, this Sub-Clause shall not apply.
The Engineer shall issue an Interim Payment Certificate for the first instalment after receiving a Statement (under Sub-Clause 14.3 [Application for Interim Payment Certificates]) and after the Employer receives (i) the Performance Security in accordance with Sub-Clause 4.2 [Performance Security] and (ii) a guarantee in amounts and currencies equal to the advance payment. This guarantee shall be issued by an entity and from within a country (or other jurisdiction) approved by the Employer, and shall be in the form annexed to the Particular Conditions or in another form approved by the Employer.
The Contractor shall ensure that the guarantee is valid and enforceable until the advance payment has been repaid, but its amount may be progressively reduced by the amount repaid by the Contractor as indicated in the Payment Certificates. If the terms of the guarantee specify its expiry date, and the advance payment has not been repaid by the date 28 days prior to the expiry date, the Contractor shall extend the validity of the guarantee until the advance payment has been repaid.
The advance payment shall be repaid through percentage deductions in Payment Certificates. Unless other percentages are stated in the Appendix to Tender:
(a) deductions shall commence in the Payment Certificate in which the total of all certified interim payments (excluding the advance payment and deductions and repayments of retention) exceeds ten per cent (10%) of the Accepted Contract Amount less Provisional Sums; and
(b) deductions shall be made at the amortisation rate of one quarter (25%) of the amount of each Payment Certificate (excluding the advance payment and deductions and repayments of retention) in the currencies and proportions of the advance payment, until such time as the advance payment has been repaid.
If the advance payment has not been repaid prior to the issue of the Taking-Over Certificate for the Works or prior to termination under Clause 15 [Termination by Employer], Clause 16 [Suspension and Termination by Contractor] or Clause 19 [Force Majeure] (as the case may be), the whole of the balance then outstanding shall immediately become due and payable by the Contractor to the Employer."
14.3,Application for Interim Payment Certificates,"The Contractor shall submit a Statement in six copies to the Engineer after the end of the period of payment stated in the Contract (if not stated, after the end of each month), in a form approved by the Engineer, showing in detail the amounts to which the Contractor considers himself to be entitled, together with supporting documents which shall include the relevant report on progress in accordance with Sub-Clause 4.21 [Progress Reports].
The Statement shall include the following items, as applicable, which shall be expressed in the various currencies in which the Contract Price is payable, in the sequence listed:
(a) the estimated contract value of the Works executed and the Contractor's Documents produced up to the end of the month (including Variations but excluding items described in sub-paragraphs (b) to (g) below);
(b) any amounts to be added and deducted for changes in legislation and changes in cost, in accordance with Sub-Clause 13.7 [Adjustments for Changes in Legislation] and Sub-Clause 13.8 [Adjustments for Changes in Cost];
(c) any amount to be deducted for retention, calculated by applying the percentage of retention stated in the Appendix to Tender to the total of the above amounts, until the amount so retained by the Employer reaches the limit of Retention Money (if any) stated in the Appendix to Tender;
(d) any amounts to be added and deducted for the advance payment and repayments in accordance with Sub-Clause 14.2 [Advance Payment];
(e) any amounts to be added and deducted for Plant and Materials in accordance with Sub-Clause 14.5 [Plant and Materials intended for the Works];
(f) any other additions or deductions which may have become due under the Contract or otherwise, including those under Clause 20 [Claims, Disputes and Arbitration]; and
(g) the deduction of amounts certified in all previous Payment Certificates."
14.4,Schedule of Payments,"If the Contract includes a Schedule of Payments specifying the instalments in which the Contract Price will be paid, then, unless otherwise stated in this Schedule:
(a) the instalments quoted in the Schedule of Payments shall be the estimated contract values for the purposes of sub-paragraph (a) of Sub-Clause 14.3 [Application for Interim Payment Certificates];
(b) Sub-Clause 14.5 [Plant and Materials intended for the Works] shall not apply; and
(c) if these instalments are not defined by reference to the actual progress achieved in executing the Works, and if actual progress is found to be less than that on which the Schedule of Payments was based, then the Engineer may proceed in accordance with Sub-Clause 3.5 [Determinations] to agree or determine revised instalments, which shall take account of the extent to which progress is less than that on which the instalments were previously based.
If the Contract does not include a Schedule of Payments, the Contractor shall submit non-binding estimates of the payments which he expects to become due during each quarterly period. The first estimate shall be submitted within 42 days after the Commencement Date. Revised estimates shall be submitted at quarterly intervals, until the Taking-Over Certificate has been issued for the Works."
14.5,Plant and Materials intended for the Works,"If this Sub-Clause applies, Interim Payment Certificates shall include, under subparagraph (e) of Sub-Clause 14.3, (i) an amount for Plant and Materials which have been sent to the Site for incorporation in the Permanent Works, and (ii) a reduction when the contract value of such Plant and Materials is included as part of the Permanent Works under sub-paragraph (a) of Sub-Clause 14.3 [Application for Interim Payment Certificates].
If the lists referred to in sub-paragraphs (b)(i) or (c)(i) below are not included in the Appendix to Tender, this Sub-Clause shall not apply.
The Engineer shall determine and certify each addition if the following conditions are satisfied:
(a) the Contractor has:
(i) kept satisfactory records (including the orders, receipts, Costs and use of Plant and Materials) which are available for inspection, and
(ii) submitted a statement of the Cost of acquiring and delivering the Plant and Materials to the Site, supported by satisfactory evidence; and either:
(b) the relevant Plant and Materials:
(i) are those listed in the Appendix to Tender for payment when shipped, (ii) have been shipped to the Country, en route to the Site, in accordance with the Contract; and
(iii) are described in a clean shipped bill of lading or other evidence of shipment, which has been submitted to the Engineer together with evidence of payment of freight and insurance, any other documents reasonably required, and a bank guarantee in a form and issued by an entity approved by the Employer in amounts and currencies equal to the amount due under this Sub-Clause: this guarantee may be in a similar form to the form referred to in Sub-Clause 14.2 [Advance Payment] and shall be valid until the Plant and Materials are properly stored on Site and protected against loss, damage or deterioration;
or
(c) the relevant Plant and Materials:
(i) are those listed in the Appendix to Tender for payment when delivered to the Site, and
(ii) have been delivered to and are properly stored on the Site, are protected against loss, damage or deterioration, and appear to be in accordance with the Contract.
The additional amount to be certified shall be the equivalent of eighty percent of the Engineer's determination of the cost of the Plant and Materials (including delivery to Site), taking account of the documents mentioned in this Sub-Clause and of the contract value of the Plant and Materials.
The currencies for this additional amount shall be the same as those in which payment will become due when the contract value is included under sub-paragraph (a) of Sub-Clause 14.3 [Application for Interim Payment Certificates]. At that time, the Payment Certificate shall include the applicable reduction which shall be equivalent to, and in the same currencies and proportions as, this additional amount for the relevant Plant and Materials."
14.6,Issue of Interim Payment Certificates,"No amount will be certified or paid until the Employer has received and approved the Performance Security. Thereafter, the Engineer shall, within 28 days after receiving a Statement and supporting documents, issue to the Employer an Interim Payment Certificate which shall state the amount which the Engineer fairly determines to be due, with supporting particulars.
However, prior to issuing the Taking-Over Certificate for the Works, the Engineer shall not be bound to issue an Interim Payment Certificate in an amount which would (after retention and other deductions) be less than the minimum amount of Interim Payment Certificates (if any) stated in the Appendix to Tender. In this event, the Engineer shall give notice to the Contractor accordingly.
An Interim Payment Certificate shall not be withheld for any other reason, although:
(a) if any thing supplied or work done by the Contractor is not in accordance with the Contract, the cost of rectification or replacement may be withheld until rectification or replacement has been completed; and/or
(b) if the Contractor was or is failing to perform any work or obligation in accordance with the Contract, and had been so notified by the Engineer, the value of this work or obligation may be withheld until the work or obligation has been performed.
The Engineer may in any Payment Certificate make any correction or modification that should properly be made to any previous Payment Certificate. A Payment Certificate shall not be deemed to indicate the Engineer's acceptance, approval, consent or satisfaction."
14.7,Payment,"The Employer shall pay to the Contractor:
(a) the first instalment of the advance payment within 42 days after issuing the Letter of Acceptance or within 21 days after receiving the documents in accordance with Sub-Clause 4.2 [Performance Security] and Sub-Clause 14.2 [Advance Payment], whichever is later;
(b) the amount certified in each Interim Payment Certificate within 56 days after the Engineer receives the Statement and supporting documents; and
(c) the amount certified in the Final Payment Certificate within 56 days after the Employer receives this Payment Certificate.
Payment of the amount due in each currency shall be made into the bank account, nominated by the Contractor, in the payment country (for this currency) specified in the Contract."
14.8,Delayed Payment,"If the Contractor does not receive payment in accordance with Sub-Clause 14.7 [Payment], the Contractor shall be entitled to receive financing charges compounded monthly on the amount unpaid during the period of delay. This period shall be deemed to commence on the date for payment specified in Sub-Clause 14.7 [Payment],irrespective (in the case of its sub-paragraph (b)) of the date on which any Interim Payment Certificate is issued.
Unless otherwise stated in the Particular Conditions, these financing charges shall be calculated at the annual rate of three percentage points above the discount rate of the central bank in the country of the currency of payment, and shall be paid in such currency.
The Contractor shall be entitled to this payment without formal notice or certification, and without prejudice to any other right or remedy."
14.9,Payment of Retention Money,"When the Taking-Over Certificate has been issued for the Works, and the Works have passed all specified tests (including the Tests after Completion, if any), the first half of the Retention Money shall be certified by the Engineer for payment to the Contractor. If a Taking-Over Certificate is issued for a Section, the relevant percentage of the first half of the Retention Money shall be certified and paid when the Section passes all tests.
Promptly after the latest of the expiry dates of the Defects Notification Periods, the outstanding balance of the Retention Money shall be certified by the Engineer for payment to the Contractor. If a Taking-Over Certificate was issued for a Section, the relevant percentage of the second half of the Retention Money shall be certified and paid promptly after the expiry date of the Defects Notification Period for the Section.
However, if any work remains to be executed under Clause 11 [Defects Liability] or Clause 12 [Tests after Completion], the Engineer shall be entitled to withhold certification of the estimated cost of this work until it has been executed.
The relevant percentage for each Section shall be the percentage value of the Section as stated in the Appendix to Tender. If the percentage value of a Section is not stated in the Appendix to Tender, no percentage of either half of the Retention Money shall be released under this Sub-Clause in respect of such Section."
14.10,Statement at Completion,"Within 84 days after receiving the Taking-Over Certificate for the Works, the Contractor shall submit to the Engineer six copies of a Statement at completion with supporting documents, in accordance with Sub-Clause 14.3 [Application for Interim Payment Certificates], showing:
(a) the value of all work done in accordance with the Contract up to the date stated in the Taking-Over Certificate for the Works,
(b) any further sums which the Contractor considers to be due, and 
(c) an estimate of any other amounts which the Contractor considers will become due to him under the Contract. Estimated amounts shall be shown separately in this Statement at completion.
The Engineer shall then certify in accordance with Sub-Clause 14.6 [Issue of Interim Payment Certificates]."
14.11,Application for Final Payment Certificate,"Within 56 days after receiving the Performance Certificate, the Contractor shall submit, to the Engineer, six copies of a draft final statement with supporting documents showing in detail in a form approved by the Engineer:
(a) the value of all work done in accordance with the Contract, and
(b) any further sums which the Contractor considers to be due to him under the Contract or otherwise.
If the Engineer disagrees with or cannot verify any part of the draft final statement, the Contractor shall submit such further information as the Engineer may reasonably require and shall make such changes in the draft as may be agreed between them.
The Contractor shall then prepare and submit to the Engineer the final statement as agreed. This agreed statement is referred to in these Conditions as the ""Final Statement"".
However if, following discussions between the Engineer and the Contractor and any changes to the draft final statement which are agreed, it becomes evident that a dispute exists, the Engineer shall deliver to the Employer (with a copy to the Contractor) an Interim Payment Certificate for the agreed parts of the draft final statement. Thereafter, if the dispute is finally resolved under Sub-Clause 20.4 [Obtaining Dispute Adjudication Board's Decision] or Sub-Clause 20.5 [Amicable Settlement], the Contractor shall then prepare and submit to the Employer (with a copy to the Engineer) a Final Statement."
14.12,Discharge,"When submitting the Final Statement, the Contractor shall submit a written discharge which confirms that the total of the Final Statement represents full and final settlement of all moneys due to the Contractor under or in connection with the Contract. This discharge may state that it becomes effective when the Contractor has received the Performance Security and the out-standing balance of this total in which event the discharge will be effective on such date."
14.13,Issue of Final Payment Certificate,"Within 28 days after receiving the Final Statement and written discharge in accordance with Sub-Clause 14.11 [Application for Final Payment Certificate] and Sub-Clause 14.12 [Discharge], the Engineer shall issue, to the Employer, the Final Payment Certificate which shall state:
(a) the amount which is finally due, and
(b) after giving credit to the Employer for all amounts previously paid by the Employer and for all sums to which the Employer is entitled, the balance (if any) due from the Employer to the Contractor or from the Contractor to the Employer, as the case may be.
If the Contractor has not applied for a Final Payment Certificate in accordance with Sub-Clause 14.11 [Application for Final Payment Certificate] and Sub-Clause 14.12 [Discharge], the Engineer shall request the Contractor to do so. If the Contractor fails to submit an application within a period of 28 days, the Engineer shall issue the Final Payment Certificate for such amount as he fairly determines to be due."
14.14,Cessation of Employer s Liability,"The Employer shall not be liable to the Contractor for any matter or thing under or in connection with the Contract or execution of the Works, except to the extent that the Contractor shall have included an amount expressly for it:
(a) in the Final Statement and also
(b) (except for matters or things arising after the issue of the Taking-Over Certificate for the Works) in the Statement at completion described in Sub-Clause 14.10 [Statement at Completion].
However, this Sub-Clause shall not limit the Employer's liability under his indemnification obligations, or the Employer's liability in any case of fraud, deliberate default or reckless misconduct by the Employer."
14.15,Currencies of Payment,"The Contract Price shall be paid in the currency or currencies named in the Appendix to Tender. Unless otherwise stated in the Particular Conditions, if more than one currency is so named, payments shall be made as follows:
(a) if the Accepted Contract Amount was expressed in Local Currency only:
(i) the proportions or amounts of the Local and Foreign Currencies, and the fixed rates of exchange to be used for calculating the payments, shall be as stated in the Appendix to Tender, except as otherwise agreed by both Parties;
(ii) payments and deductions under Sub-Clause 13.5 [Provisional Sums] and Sub-Clause 13.7 [Adjustments for Changes in Legislation] shall be made in the applicable currencies and proportions; and
(iii) other payments and deductions under sub-paragraphs (a) to (d) of Sub-Clause 14.3 [Application for Interim Payment Certificates] shall be made
in the currencies and proportions specified in sub-paragraph (a)(i) above;
(b) payment of the damages specified in the Appendix to Tender shall be made in the currencies and proportions specified in the Appendix to Tender;
(c) other payments to the Employer by the Contractor shall be made in the currency in which the sum was expended by the Employer, or in such currency as may be agreed by both Parties;
(d) if any amount payable by the Contractor to the Employer in a particular currency exceeds the sum payable by the Employer to the Contractor in that currency, the Employer may recover the balance of this amount from the sums otherwise payable to the Contractor in other currencies; and
(e) if no rates of exchange are stated in the Appendix to Tender, they shall be those prevailing on the Base Date and determined by the central bank of the Country."
15.1,Notice to Correct,"If the Contractor fails to carry out any obligation under the Contract, the Engineer may by notice require the Contractor to make good the failure and to remedy it within a specified reasonable time."
15.2,Termination by Employer,"The Employer shall be entitled to terminate the Contract if the Contractor:A
(a) fails to comply with Sub-Clause 4.2 [Performance Security] or with a notice under Sub-Clause 15.1 [Notice to Correct],
(b) abandons the Works or otherwise plainly demonstrates the intention not to continue performance of his obligations under the Contract,

(f) gives or offers to give (directly or indirectly) to any person any bribe, gift, gratuity, commission or other thing of value, as an inducement or reward:
(i) for doing or forbearing to do any action in relation to the Contract, or

or if any of the Contractor's Personnel, agents or Subcontractors gives or offers to give (directly or indirectly) to any person any such inducement or reward as is described in this sub-paragraph (f). However, lawful inducements and rewards to Contractor's Personnel shall not entitle termination.
In any of these events or circumstances, the Employer may, upon giving 14 days' notice to the Contractor, terminate the Contract and expel the Contractor from the Site. However, in the case of sub-paragraph (e) or (f), the Employer may by notice terminate the Contract immediately.
The Employer's election to terminate the Contract shall not prejudice any other rights of the Employer, under the Contract or otherwise.
The Contractor shall then leave the Site and deliver any required Goods, all Contractor's Documents, and other design documents made by or for him, to the Engineer. However, the Contractor shall use his best efforts to comply immediately with any reasonable instructions included in the notice (i) for the assignment of any subcontract, and (ii) for the protection of life or property or for the safety of the Works.
After termination, the Employer may complete the Works and/or arrange for any other entities to do so. The Employer and these entities may then use any Goods, Contractor's Documents and other design documents made by or on behalf of the Contractor.
The Employer shall then give notice that the Contractor's Equipment and Temporary Works will be released to the Contractor at or near the Site. The Contractor shall promptly arrange their removal, at the risk and cost of the Contractor. However, if by this time the Contractor has failed to make a payment due to the Employer, these items may be sold by the Employer in order to recover this payment. Any balance of the proceeds shall then be paid to the Contractor."
15.3,Valuation at Date of Termination,"As soon as practicable after a notice of termination under Sub-Clause 15.2 [Termination by Employer] has taken effect, the Engineer shall proceed in accordance with Sub-Clause 3.5 [Determinations] to agree or determine the value of the Works, Goods and Contractor's Documents, and any other sums due to the Contractor for  work executed in accordance with the Contract."

The Contractor's action shall not prejudice his entitlements to financing charges under Sub-Clause 14.8 [Delayed Payment] and to termination under Sub-Clause 16.2 [Termination by Contractor].
If the Contractor subsequently receives such Payment Certificate, evidence or payment (as described in the relevant Sub-Clause and in the above notice) before giving a notice of termination, the Contractor shall resume normal working as soon as is reasonably practicable.

If a Taking-Over Certificate is issued (or is so deemed to be issued) for any Section or part of the Works, responsibility for the care of the Section or part shall then pass to the Employer.
After responsibility has accordingly passed to the Employer, the Contractor shall take responsibility for the care of any work which is outstanding on the date stated in a Taking-Over Certificate, until this outstanding work has been completed.
If any loss or damage happens to the Works, Goods or Contractor's Documents during the period when the Contractor is responsible for their care, from any cause not listed in Sub-Clause 17.3 [Employer's Risks], the Contractor shall rectify the loss or damage at the Contractor's risk and cost, so that the Works, Goods and Contractor's Documents conform with the Contract.
The Contractor shall be liable for any loss or damage caused by any actions performed by the Contractor after a Taking-Over Certificate has been issued. The Contractor shall also be liable for any loss or damage which occurs after a Taking-Over Certificate has been issued and which arose from a previous event for which the Contractor was liable."

17.4,Consequences of Employer s Risks,"If and to the extent that any of the risks listed in Sub-Clause 17.3 above results in loss or damage to the Works, Goods or Contractor's Documents, the Contractor shall promptly give notice to the Engineer and shall rectify this loss or damage to the extent required by the Engineer.
If the Contractor suffers delay and/or incurs Cost from rectifying this loss or damage, the Contractor shall give a further notice to the Engineer and shall be entitled subject to Sub-Clause 20.1 [Contractor's Claims] to:

Whenever a Party does not give notice to the other Party of any claim within 28 days of receiving the claim, the first Party shall be deemed to have waived any right to indemnity under this Sub-Clause.
The Employer shall indemnify and hold the Contractor harmless against and from any claim alleging an infringement which is or was:
(a) an unavoidable result of the Contractor's compliance with the Employer's Requirements, or
(b) a result of any Works being used by the Employer:
(i) for a purpose other than that indicated by, or reasonably to be inferred from, the Contract, or
(ii) in conjunction with any thing not supplied by the Contractor, unless such use was disclosed to the Contractor prior to the Base Date or is stated in the Contract.
The Contractor shall indemnify and hold the Employer harmless against and from any other claim which arises out of or in relation to (i) the Contractor's design, manufacture, construction or execution of the Works, (ii) the use of Contractor's Equipment, or (iii) the proper use of the Works.
If a Party is entitled to be indemnified under this Sub-Clause, the indemnifying Party may (at its cost) conduct negotiations for the settlement of the claim, and any litigation or arbitration which may arise from it. The other Party shall, at the request and cost of the indemnifying Party, assist in contesting the claim. This other Party (and its Personnel) shall not make any admission which might be prejudicial to the indemnifying Party, unless the indemnifying Party failed to take over the conduct of any negotiations, litigation or arbitration upon being requested to do so by such other Party."
17.6,Limitation of Liability,"Neither Party shall be liable to the other Party for loss of use of any Works, loss of profit, loss of any contract or for any indirect or consequential loss or damage which may be suffered by the other Party in connection with the Contract, other than under Sub-Clause 16.4 [Payment on Termination] and Sub-Clause 17.1 [Indemnities].

This Sub-Clause shall not limit liability in any case of fraud, deliberate default or reckless misconduct by the defaulting Party."
18.1,General Requirements for Insurances,"In this Clause, ""insuring Party"" means, for each type of insurance, the Party responsible for effecting and maintaining the insurance specified in the relevant Sub-Clause.
Wherever the Contractor is the insuring Party, each insurance shall be effected with insurers and in terms approved by the Employer. These terms shall be consistent with any terms agreed by both Parties before the date of the Letter of Acceptance. This agreement of terms shall take precedence over the provisions of this Clause.
Wherever the Employer is the insuring Party, each insurance shall be effected with insurers and in terms consistent with the details annexed to the Particular Conditions.
If a policy is required to indemnify joint insured, the cover shall apply separately to each insured as though a separate policy had been issued for each of the joint insured. If a policy indemnifies additional joint insured, namely in addition to the insured specified in this Clause, (i) the Contractor shall act under the policy on behalf of these additional joint insured except that the Employer shall act for Employer's Personnel, (ii) additional joint insured shall not be entitled to receive payments directly from the insurer or to have any other direct dealings with the insurer, and (iii) the insuring Party shall require all additional joint insured to comply with the conditions stipulated in the policy.
Each policy insuring against loss or damage shall provide for payments to be made in the currencies required to rectify the loss or damage. Payments received from insurers shall be used for the rectification of the loss or damage.
The relevant insuring Party shall, within the respective periods stated in the Appendix to Tender (calculated from the Commencement Date), submit to the other Party:
(a) evidence that the insurances described in this Clause have been effected, and 
(b) copies of the policies for the insurances described in Sub-Clause 18.2 [Insurance for Works and Contractor's Equipment] and Sub-Clause 18.3 [Insurance against Injury to Persons and Damage to Property].
When each premium is paid, the insuring Party shall submit evidence of payment to the other Party. Whenever evidence or policies are submitted, the insuring Party shall also give notice to the Engineer.
Each Party shall comply with the conditions stipulated in each of the insurance policies. The insuring Party shall keep the insurers informed of any relevant changes to the execution of the Works and ensure that insurance is maintained in accordance with this Clause.
Neither Party shall make any material alteration to the terms of any insurance without the prior approval of the other Party. If an insurer makes (or attempts to make) any alteration, the Party first notified by the insurer shall promptly give notice to the other Party.
If the insuring Party fails to effect and keep in force any of the insurances it is required to effect and maintain under the Contract, or fails to provide satisfactory evidence and copies of policies in accordance with this Sub-Clause, the other Party may (at its option and without prejudice to any other right or remedy) effect insurance for the relevant coverage and pay the premiums due. The insuring Party shall pay the amount of these premiums to the other Party, and the Contract Price shall be adjusted accordingly.
Nothing in this Clause limits the obligations, liabilities or responsibilities of the Contractor or the Employer, under the other terms of the Contract or otherwise. Any amounts not insured or not recovered from the insurers shall be borne by the Contractor and/or the Employer in accordance with these obligations, liabilities or responsibilities. However, if the insuring Party fails to effect and keep in force an insurance which is available and which it is required to effect and maintain under the Contract, and the other Party neither approves the omission nor effects insurance for the coverage relevant to this default, any moneys which should have been recoverable under this insurance shall be paid by the insuring Party.
Payments by one Party to the other Party shall be subject to Sub-Clause 2.5 [Employer's Claims] or Sub-Clause 20.1 [Contractor's Claims], as applicable"
18.2,Insurance for Works and Contractor s Equipment,"The insuring Party shall insure the Works, Plant, Materials and Contractor's Documents for not less than the full reinstatement cost including the costs of demolition, removal of debris and professional fees and profit. This insurance shall be effective from the date by which the evidence is to be submitted under sub-paragraph (a) of Sub-Clause 18.1 [General Requirements for Insurances], until the date of issue of the Taking-Over Certificate for the Works.
The insuring Party shall maintain this insurance to provide cover until the date of issue of the Performance Certificate, for loss or damage for which the Contractor is liable arising from a cause occurring prior to the issue of the Taking-Over Certificate, and for loss or damage caused by the Contractor in the course of any other operations (including those under Clause 11 [Defects Liability] and Clause 12 [Tests after Completion]).
The insuring Party shall insure the Contractor's Equipment for not less than the full replacement value, including delivery to Site. For each item of Contractor's Equipment, the insurance shall be effective while it is being transported to the Site and until it is no longer required as Contractor's Equipment.
Unless otherwise stated in the Particular Conditions, insurances under this Sub-Clause:
(a) shall be effected and maintained by the Contractor as insuring Party,
(b) shall be in the joint names of the Parties, who shall be jointly entitled to receive payments from the insurers, payments being held or allocated between the Parties for the sole purpose of rectifying the loss or damage,
(c) shall cover all loss and damage from any cause not listed in Sub-Clause 17.3 [Employer's Risks],
(d) shall also cover loss or damage to a part of the Works which is attributable to the use or occupation by the Employer of another part of the Works, and loss or damage from the risks listed in sub-paragraphs (c), (g) and (h) of Sub-Clause 17.3 [Employer's Risks], excluding (in each case) risks which are not insurable at commercially reasonable terms, with deductibles per occurrence of not more than the amount stated in the Appendix to Tender (if an amount is not so stated, this sub-paragraph (d) shall not apply), and
(e) may however exclude loss of, damage to, and reinstatement of:
(i) a part of the Works which is in a defective condition due to a defect in its design, materials or workmanship (but cover shall include any other parts which are lost or damaged as a direct result of this defective condition and not as described in sub-paragraph (ii) below),
(ii) a part of the Works which is lost or damaged in order to reinstate any
other part of the Works if this other part is in a defective condition due to a defect in its design, materials or workmanship,
(iii) a part of the Works which has been taken over by the Employer, except to the extent that the Contractor is liable for the loss or damage, and
(iv) Goods while they are not in the Country, subject to Sub-Clause 14.5 [Plant and Materials intended for the Works].
If, more than one year after the Base Date, the cover described in sub-paragraph (d) above ceases to be available at commercially reasonable terms, the Contractor shall (as insuring Party) give notice to the Employer, with supporting particulars.
The Employer shall then (i) be entitled subject to Sub-Clause 2.5 [Employer's Claims] to payment of an amount equivalent to such commercially reasonable terms as the Contractor should have expected to have paid for such cover, and (ii) be deemed, unless he obtains the cover at commercially reasonable terms, to have approved the omission under Sub-Clause 18.1 [General Requirements for Insurances]."
18.3,Insurance against Injury to Persons and Damage to Property,"The insuring Party shall insure against each Party's liability for any loss, damage, death or bodily injury which may occur to any physical property (except things insured under Sub-Clause 18.2 [Insurance for Works and Contractor's Equipment]) or to any person (except persons insured under Sub-Clause 18.4 [Insurance for Contractor's Personnel]), which may arise out of the Contractor's performance of the Contract and occurring before the issue of the Performance Certificate.
This insurance shall be for a limit per occurrence of not less than the amount stated in the Appendix to Tender, with no limit on the number of occurrences. If an amount is not stated in the Appendix to Tender, this Sub-Clause shall not apply.
Unless otherwise stated in the Particular Conditions, the insurances specified in this Sub-Clause:
(a) shall be effected and maintained by the Contractor as insuring Party,
(b) shall be in the joint names of the Parties,
(c) shall be extended to cover liability for all loss and damage to the Employer's property (except things insured under Sub-Clause 18.2) arising out of the Contractor's performance of the Contract, and
(d) may however exclude liability to the extent that it arises from:
(i) the Employer's right to have the Permanent Works executed on, over, under, in or through any land, and to occupy this land for the Permanent Works,
(ii) damage which is an unavoidable result of the Contractor's obligations to execute the Works and remedy any defects, and
(iii) a cause listed in Sub-Clause 17.3 [Employer's Risks], except to the extent that cover is available at commercially reasonable terms."
18.4,Insurance for Contractor s Personnel,"The Contractor shall effect and maintain insurance against liability for claims, damages, losses and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) arising from injury, sickness, disease or death of any person employed by the Contractor or any other of the Contractor's Personnel.
The Employer and the Engineer shall also be indemnified under the policy of insurance, except that this insurance may exclude losses and claims to the extent that they arise from any act or neglect of the Employer or of the Employer's Personnel.
The insurance shall be maintained in full force and effect during the whole time that these personnel are assisting in the execution of the Works. For a Subcontractor's employees, the insurance may be effected by the Subcontractor, but the Contractor shall be responsible for compliance with this Clause."
19.1,Definition of Force Majeure,"In this Clause, ""Force Majeure"" means an exceptional event or circumstance:
(a) which is beyond a Party's control,
(b) which such Party could not reasonably have provided against before entering into the Contract,
(c) which, having arisen, such Party could not reasonably have avoided or overcome, and
(d) which is not substantially attributable to the other Party.
Force Majeure may include, but is not limited to, exceptional events or circumstances of the kind listed below, so long as conditions (a) to (d) above are satisfied:
(i) war, hostilities (whether war be declared or not), invasion, act of foreign enemies,
(ii) rebellion, terrorism, revolution, insurrection, military or usurped power, or civil war,
(iii) riot, commotion, disorder, strike or lockout by persons other than the Contractor's Personnel and other employees of the Contractor and Subcontractors,
(iv) munitions of war, explosive materials, ionising radiation or contamination by radio-activity, except as may be attributable to the Contractor's use of such munitions, explosives, radiation or radio-activity, and
(v) natural catastrophes such as earthquake, hurricane, typhoon or volcanic activity."
19.2,Notice of Force Majeure,"If a Party is or will be prevented from performing any of its obligations under the Contract by Force Majeure, then it shall give notice to the other Party of the event or circumstances constituting the Force Majeure and shall specify the obligations, the performance of which is or will be prevented. The notice shall be given within 14 days after the Party became aware, or should have become aware, of the relevant event or circumstance constituting Force Majeure.
The Party shall, having given notice, be excused performance of such obligations for so long as such Force Majeure prevents it from performing them.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Clause, Force Majeure shall not apply to obligations of either Party to make payments to the other Party under the Contract."
19.3,Duty to Minimise Delay,"Each Party shall at all times use all reasonable endeavours to minimise any delay in the performance of the Contract as a result of Force Majeure.
A Party shall give notice to the other Party when it ceases to be affected by the Force Majeure."
19.4,Consequences of Force Majeure,"If the Contractor is prevented from performing any of his obligations under the Contract by Force Majeure of which notice has been given under Sub-Clause 19.2 [Notice of Force Majeure], and suffers delay and/or incurs Cost by reason of such Force Majeure, the Contractor shall be entitled subject to Sub-Clause 20.1 [Contractor's Claims] to:
(a) an extension of time for any such delay, if completion is or will be delayed, under Sub-Clause 8.4 [Extension of Time for Completion], and
(b) if the event or circumstance is of the kind described in sub-paragraphs (i) to (iv) of Sub-Clause 19.1 [Definition of Force Majeure] and, in the case of subparagraphs (ii) to (iv), occurs in the Country, payment of any such Cost.
After receiving this notice, the Engineer shall proceed in accordance with Sub-Clause 3.5 [Determinations] to agree or determine these matters."
19.5,Force Majeure Affecting Sub-contractor,"If any Subcontractor is entitled under any contract or agreement relating to the Works to relief from force majeure on terms additional to or broader than those specified in this Clause, such additional or broader force majeure events or circumstances shall not excuse the Contractor's non-performance or entitle him to relief under this Clause."
19.6,"Optional Termination, Payment and Release","If the execution of substantially all the Works in progress is prevented for a continuous period of 84 days by reason of Force Majeure of which notice has been given under Sub-Clause 19.2 [Notice of Force Majeure], or for multiple periods which total more than 140 days due to the same notified Force Majeure, then either Party may give to the other Party a notice of termination of the Contract. In this event, the termination shall take effect 7 days after the notice is given, and the Contractor shall proceed in accordance with Sub-Clause 16.3 [Cessation of Work and Removal of Contractor's Equipment].
Upon such termination, the Engineer shall determine the value of the work done and issue a Payment Certificate which shall include:
(a) the amounts payable for any work carried out for which a price is stated in the Contract;
(b) the Cost of Plant and Materials ordered for the Works which have been delivered to the Contractor, or of which the Contractor is liable to accept delivery: this Plant and Materials shall become the property of (and be at the risk of) the Employer when paid for by the Employer, and the Contractor shall place the same at the Employer's disposal;
(c) any other Cost or liability which in the circumstances was reasonably incurred by the Contractor in the expectation of completing the Works;
(d) the Cost of removal of Temporary Works and Contractor's Equipment from the Site and the return of these items to the Contractor's works in his country (or to any other destination at no greater cost); and
(e) the Cost of repatriation of the Contractor's staff and labour employed wholly in connection with the Works at the date of termination."
19.7,Release from Performance under the Law,"Notwithstanding any other provision of this Clause, if any event or circumstance outside the control of the Parties (including, but not limited to, Force Majeure) arises which makes it impossible or unlawful for either or both Parties to fulfil its or their contractual obligations or which, under the law governing the Contract, entitles the Parties to be released from further performance of the Contract, then upon notice by either Party to the other Party of such event or circumstance:
(a) the Parties shall be discharged from further performance, without prejudice to the rights of either Party in respect of any previous breach of the Contract, and (b) the sum payable by the Employer to the Contractor shall be the same as would have been payable under Sub-Clause 19.6 [Optional Termination, Payment and Release] if the Contract had been terminated under Sub-Clause 19.6."
20.1,Contractor s Claims,"If the Contractor considers himself to be entitled to any extension of the Time for Completion and/or any additional payment, under any Clause of these Conditions or otherwise in connection with the Contract, the Contractor shall give notice to the Engineer, describing the event or circumstance giving rise to the claim. The notice shall be given as soon as practicable, and not later than 28 days after the Contractor became aware, or should have become aware, of the event or circumstance.
If the Contractor fails to give notice of a claim within such period of 28 days, the Time for Completion shall not be extended, the Contractor shall not be entitled to additional payment, and the Employer shall be discharged from all liability in connection with the claim. Otherwise, the following provisions of this Sub-Clause shall apply.
The Contractor shall also submit any other notices which are required by the Contract, and supporting particulars for the claim, all as relevant to such event or circumstance.

Without admitting the Employer's liability, the Engineer may, after receiving any notice under this Sub-Clause, monitor the record-keeping and/or instruct the Contractor to keep further contemporary records. The Contractor shall permit the Engineer to inspect all these records, and shall (if instructed) submit copies to the Engineer.
Within 42 days after the Contractor became aware (or should have become aware) of the event or circumstance giving rise to the claim, or within such other period as may be proposed by the Contractor and approved by the Engineer, the Contractor shall send to the Engineer a fully detailed claim which includes full supporting particulars of the basis of the claim and of the extension of time and/or additional payment claimed.
If the event or circumstance giving rise to the claim has a continuing effect:
(a) this fully detailed claim shall be considered as interim;
(b) the Contractor shall send further interim claims at monthly intervals, giving the accumulated delay and/or amount claimed, and such further particulars as the Engineer may reasonably require; and
(c) the Contractor shall send a final claim within 28 days after the end of the effects resulting from the event or circumstance, or within such other period as may be proposed by the Contractor and approved by the Engineer.
Within 42 days after receiving a claim or any further particulars supporting a previous claim, or within such other period as may be proposed by the Engineer and approved by the Contractor, the Engineer shall respond with approval, or with disapproval and detailed comments. He may also request any necessary further particulars, but shall nevertheless give his response on the principles of the claim within such time.
Each Payment Certificate shall include such amounts for any claim as have been reasonably substantiated as due under the relevant provision of the Contract. Unless and until the particulars supplied are sufficient to substantiate the whole of the claim, the Contractor shall only be entitled to payment for such part of the claim as he has been able to substantiate.
The Engineer shall proceed in accordance with Sub-Clause 3.5 [Determinations] to agree or determine (i) the extension (if any) of the Time for Completion (before or after its expiry) in accordance with Sub-Clause 8.4 [Extension of Time for Completion], and/or (ii) the additional payment (if any) to which the Contractor is entitled under the Contract.
The requirements of this Sub-Clause are in addition to those of any other Sub-Clause which may apply to a claim. If the Contractor fails to comply with this or another Sub-Clause in relation to any claim, any extension of time and/or additional payment shall take account of the extent (if any) to which the failure has prevented or prejudiced proper investigation of the claim, unless the claim is excluded under the second paragraph of this Sub-Clause."
20.2,Appointment of the Dispute Adjudication Board,"Disputes shall be adjudicated by a DAB in accordance with Sub-Clause 20.4 [Obtaining Dispute Adjudication Board's Decision]. The Parties shall jointly appoint a DAB by the date 28 days after a Party gives notice to the other Party of its intention to refer a dispute to a DAB in accordance with Sub-Clause 20.4.
The DAB shall comprise, as stated in the Appendix to Tender, either one or three suitably qualified persons (""the members""). If the number is not so stated and the Parties do not agree otherwise, the DAB shall comprise three persons.
If the DAB is to comprise three persons, each Party shall nominate one member for the approval of the other Party. The Parties shall consult both these members and shall agree upon the third member, who shall be appointed to act as chairman.
However, if a list of potential members is included in the Contract, the members shall be selected from those on the list, other than anyone who is unable or unwilling to accept appointment to the DAB.
The agreement between the Parties and either the sole member (""adjudicator"") or each of the three members shall incorporate by reference the General Conditions of Dispute Adjudication Agreement contained in the Appendix to these General Conditions, with such amendments as are agreed between them.
The terms of the remuneration of either the sole member or each of the three members shall be mutually agreed upon by the Parties when agreeing the terms of appointment. Each Party shall be responsible for paying one-half of this remuneration.
If at any time the Parties so agree, they may appoint a suitably qualified person or persons to replace any one or more members of the DAB. Unless the Parties agree otherwise, the appointment will come into effect if a member declines to act or is unable to act as a result of death, disability, resignation or termination of appointment.
The replacement shall be appointed in the same manner as the replaced person was required to have been nominated or agreed upon, as described in this Sub-Clause.
The appointment of any member may be terminated by mutual agreement of both Parties, but not by the Employer or the Contractor acting alone. Unless otherwise agreed by both Parties, the appointment of the DAB (including each member) shall expire when the DAB has given its decision on the dispute referred to it under Sub-Clause 20.4 [Obtaining Dispute Adjudication Board s Decision], unless other disputes have been referred to the DAB by that time under Sub-Clause 20.4, in which event the relevant date shall be when the DAB has also given decisions on those disputes."
20.3,Failure to Agree Dispute Adjudication Board,"If any of the following conditions apply, namely:
(a) the Parties fail to agree upon the appointment of the sole member of the DAB by the date stated in the first paragraph of Sub-Clause 20.2 [Appointment of the Dispute Adjudication Board],
(b) either Party fails to nominate a member (for approval by the other Party) of a DAB of three persons by such date,
(c) the Parties fail to agree upon the appointment of the third member (to act as chairman) of the DAB by such date, or
(d) the Parties fail to agree upon the appointment of a replacement person within 42 days after the date on which the sole member or one of the three members declines to act or is unable to act as a result of death, disability, resignation or termination of appointment, 
then the appointing entity or official named in the Appendix to Tender shall, upon the request of either or both of the Parties and after due consultation with both Parties, appoint this member of the DAB. This appointment shall be final and conclusive. Each Party shall be responsible for paying one-half of the remuneration of the appointing entity or official."
20.4,Obtaining Dispute Adjudication Board s Decision,"If a dispute (of any kind whatsoever) arises between the Parties in connection with, or arising out of, the Contract or the execution of the Works, including any dispute as to any certificate, determination, instruction, opinion or valuation of the Engineer, then after a DAB has been appointed pursuant to Sub-Clauses 20.2 [Appointment of the DAB] and 20.3 [Failure to Agree DAB] either Party may refer the dispute in writing to the DAB for its decision, with copies to the other Party and the Engineer. Such reference shall state that it is given under this Sub-Clause.
For a DAB of three persons, the DAB shall be deemed to have received such reference on the date when it is received by the chairman of the DAB. 
Both Parties shall promptly make available to the DAB all information, access to the Site, and appropriate facilities, as the DAB may require for the purposes of making a decision on such dispute. The DAB shall be deemed to be not acting as arbitrator(s).
Within 84 days after receiving such reference, or the advance payment referred to in Clause 6 of the Appendix - General Conditions of Dispute Adjudication Agreement, whichever date is later, or within such other period as may be proposed by the DAB and approved by both Parties, the DAB shall give its decision, which shall be reasoned and shall state that it is given under this Sub-Clause. However, if neither of the Parties has paid in full the invoices submitted by each member pursuant to Clause 6 of the Appendix, the DAB shall not be obliged to give its decision until such invoices have been paid in full. The decision shall be binding on both Parties, who shall promptly give effect to it unless and until it shall be revised in an amicable settlement or an arbitral award as described below. Unless the Contract has already been abandoned, repudiated or terminated, the Contractor shall continue to proceed with the Works in accordance with the Contract.
If either Party is dissatisfied with the DAB's decision, then either Party may, within 28 days after receiving the decision, give notice to the other Party of its dissatisfaction. If the DAB fails to give its decision within the period of 84 days (or as otherwise approved) after receiving such reference or such payment, then either Party may, within 28 days after this period has expired, give notice to the other Party of its dissatisfaction.
In either event, this notice of dissatisfaction shall state that it is given under this Sub-Clause, and shall set out the matter in dispute and the reason(s) for dissatisfaction.
Except as stated in Sub-Clause 20.7 [Failure to Comply with Dispute Adjudication Board's Decision] and Sub-Clause 20.8 [Expiry of Dispute Adjudication Board's Appointment], neither Party shall be entitled to commence arbitration of a dispute unless a notice of dissatisfaction has been given in accordance with this Sub-Clause.
If the DAB has given its decision as to a matter in dispute to both Parties, and no notice of dissatisfaction has been given by either Party within 28 days after it received the DAB's decision, then the decision shall become final and binding upon both Parties."
20.5,Amicable Settlement,"Where notice of dissatisfaction has been given under Sub-Clause 20.4 above, both Parties shall attempt to settle the dispute amicably before the commencement of arbitration. However, unless both Parties agree otherwise, arbitration may be commenced on or after the fifty-sixth day after the day on which notice of dissatisfaction was given, even if no attempt at amicable settlement has been made"
20.6,Arbitration,"Unless settled amicably, any dispute in respect of which the DAB's decision (if any) has not become final and binding shall be finally settled by international arbitration. Unless otherwise agreed by both Parties:
(a) the dispute shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce,
(b) the dispute shall be settled by three arbitrators appointed in accordance with these Rules, and
(c) the arbitration shall be conducted in the language for communications defined in Sub-Clause 1.4 [Law and Language].
The arbitrator(s) shall have full power to open up, review and revise any certificate, determination, instruction, opinion or valuation of the Engineer, and any decision of the DAB, relevant to the dispute. Nothing shall disqualify the Engineer from being called as a witness and giving evidence before the arbitrator(s) on any matter whatsoever relevant to the dispute.
Neither Party shall be limited in the proceedings before the arbitrator(s) to the evidence or arguments previously put before the DAB to obtain its decision, or to the reasons for dissatisfaction given in its notice of dissatisfaction. Any decision of the DAB shall be admissible in evidence in the arbitration.
Arbitration may be commenced prior to or after completion of the Works. The obligations of the Parties, the Engineer and the DAB shall not be altered by reason of any arbitration being conducted during the progress of the Works."
20.7,Failure to Comply with Dispute Adjudication Board's Decision,"In the event that:
(a) neither Party has given notice of dissatisfaction within the period stated in Sub-Clause 20.4 [Obtaining Dispute Adjudication Board's Decision],
(b) the DAB's related decision (if any) has become final and binding, and (c) a Party fails to comply with this decision,
then the other Party may, without prejudice to any other rights it may have, refer the failure itself to arbitration under Sub-Clause 20.6 [Arbitration]. Sub-Clause 20.4 [Obtaining Dispute Adjudication Board's Decision] and Sub-Clause 20.5 [Amicable Settlement] shall not apply to this reference."
20.8,Expiry of Dispute Adjudication Board's Appointment,"If a dispute arises between the Parties in connection with, or arising out of, the Contract or the execution of the Works and there is no DAB in place, whether by reason of the expiry of the DAB's appointment or otherwise:
(a) Sub-Clause 20.4 [Obtaining Dispute Adjudication Board's Decision] and Sub-Clause 20.5 [Amicable Settlement] shall not apply, and
(b) the dispute may be referred directly to arbitration under Sub-Clause 20.6 [Arbitration]."
